## 📄 Disclaimer

- Data is community-maintained and may contain inconsistencies.
- Chances are simplified for multiple rolls in a single drop.
- Chances assume full potential (e.g. Ring of Wealth, Barrows points, etc) with an exception to point-driven loot tables (e.g. Ancient Chest). In this case, check the item's table chance or use the Probability Calculator for custom math.
